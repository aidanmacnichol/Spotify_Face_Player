# Spotify_Face_Player
Automatically start and stop Spotify playback depending on if you are at your computer or not

You will need to setup spotify API stuff yourself. 

Lots of future improvements can be made when I have more time:
- Create functions to automatically setup device ID 
- Use enviroment variables to hold secret spotify clients 
- Thread the facial recognition so that stopping playback is less jumpy
- Currently the stop and start playback functions authorize spotify each time which is needlessly redundant 
- add a requirments.txt for easier setup on new computers
